# lemonbar-xft-desktop
Personal fork of lemonbar-xft that makes the bar integrated into the Desktop by removing the margins and window order. All credits go to The Lemon Man

## Changelog
- Commented out lines that determined the margin of lemonbar in the strut array
- Used `_NET_WM_DESKTOP` instead of `_NET_WM_DOCK` in the strut array

## Use
Its as easy as compiling the code and moving to a directory such as `/usr/local/bin`
